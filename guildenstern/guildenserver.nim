## [GuildenServer] is the abstract base class for upstream (app-facing) web servers. The three concrete server implementations that currently ship
## with GuildenStern are [guildenstern/httpserver], [guildenstern/websocketserver] and [guildenstern/multipartserver].
## One server is associated with one TCP port.
## 
## GuildenServer mainly acts as the glue between everything else, offering set of callback hooks for others to fill in.
## In addition to GuildenServer, this module also introduces SocketContext, which is a container for data of
## one request in flight. SocketContext is inheritable, so concrete servers may add properties to it.
## 
## The overall architecture may be something like this: A reverse proxy (like https://caddyserver.com/) routes requests upsteam to multiple ports.
## Each of these ports is served by one concrete GuildenServer instance. To each server is attached one dispatcher, which listens to the port and
## triggers handlerCallbacks. The default [guildenstern/dispatcher] uses multithreading so that even requests arriving to the same port are served in parallel.
## During request handling, the default servers offer an inherited thread local SocketContext variable from which everything else is accessible,
## most notably the SocketData.server itself and the SocketData.socket that is being serviced.
## 
## Guides for writing your very own servers and dispatchers may appear later. For now, just study the source codes...
## (And if you invent something useful, please share it with us.)
